# Simple Todo App

This page is designed to be a little helper for you, a simple space where you can create a To-do list.

## Functionality

Tasks can be added via the "Add Todo" button, a form will appear asking you what your task is as well as the due date of that task. The counter above will update accordingly. When you complete your task, the checkbox can be clicked to cross the item off your list and the counter will update to show your progress.

The task list and counter will also update accordingly if you delete a task, but tsk-tsk that's not how you hold yourself accountable! Look at those completed tasks! You did that! Go you!


## Technology

In this project I used form validation to make sure the tasks appear correctly, for example the task input asking for a date will give you an error if you try to set a task for a date that's in the past.

The main portion of the project is OOP, Object Oriented Programming. OOP is basically a specific way of writing JavaScript, so that the program is not only easier to read for other coders but should run smoother as well.

I also spent a long time getting the todo counter to work, but I don't really know how to describe what I did? It was mostly little adjustments that took a keen eye to find where they needed to be implemented. I just want to make it known how hard I worked on it. I cried at one point. It was rough. But I did it!
