# Simple Todo App

This page is designed to be a little helper for you, a simple space where you can create a To-do list.

## Functionality

Tasks can be added via the "Add Todo" button, a form will appear asking you what your task is as well as the due date of that task. When you complete your task, the checkbox can be clicked to cross the item off your list.

## Technology

In this project I used form validation to make sure the tasks appear correctly, for example the task input asking for a date will give you an error if you try to set a task for a date that's in the past.

The main portion of the project is OOP, Object Oriented Programming. OOP is basically a specific way of writing JavaScript, so that the program is not only easier to read for other coders but should run smoother as well.
